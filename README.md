# CSSIx-Jukebox
A jukebox made as a team during CSSIx
This was the final project that I worked on during CSSIx, a summer program by Google. 
Its a simple "jukebox" with a play button integrated into the 9 songs available, a pause button (which currently doesn't work), and a stop button. 
There is also an audio visualizer included which was where I specifically spent most of my time coding.
It works using simple if and else statements mainly.
Currently the code doesn't work because I removed the music before uploading
There is also a weird bug that when the code is run, it uses 2.5gb of ram.
